-------------------- Input file Statistics --------------------
Total 5 files
Malware Count : 5


-------------------- Malware input statistics for Evasion Attacks --------------------
5 malware in total.
5 malware predicted as malware at least by one detector
These 5 malware will be used to produce adversarial malware.


-------------------- Evasion results --------------------
adversary: FGSM
Successful Evasion Rate 0.4
Two Models True, Acc against adv_x (at least one detector predicted as malware): 0.6
False Positive: 2, which evade detectors successfully in the end. (5 test samples in total)
False Positive just by benign content: 2, which evade successfully just by benign content or random bytes initiation. Corresponding Evasion Rate 0.4
False Positive just by FGSM: 0, which evade successfully just by benign content or random bytes initiation. Corresponding Evasion Rate 0.0
Model1: 0.6 accuracy for detecting adversarial malware. FP: 2 number of adv_x evade successfully.
Model2: 0.0 accuracy for detecting adversarial malware. FP: 5 number of adv_x evade successfully.
Average number of index crafted for each file: 2266.0
Average number of index crafted by gradient optimization for each file: 77.0
5 out of 5 PE files used as testing files (to evade detectors).
0 files that can not processed/identified as PE binary. Filter out!
test time: 0h 1m 16s.
