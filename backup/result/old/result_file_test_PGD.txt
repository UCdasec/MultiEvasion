-------------------- Input file Statistics --------------------
Total 5 files
Malware Count : 5


-------------------- Malware input statistics for Evasion Attacks --------------------
5 malware in total.
5 malware predicted as malware at least by one detector
These 5 malware will be used to produce adversarial malware.


-------------------- Evasion results --------------------
adversary: PGD
Successful Evasion Rate 0.8
Two Models True, Acc against adv_x (at least one detector predicted as malware): 0.2
False Positive: 4, which evade detectors successfully in the end. (5 test samples in total)
False Positive just by benign content: 2, which evade successfully just by benign content or random bytes initiation. Corresponding Evasion Rate 0.4
False Positive just by PGD: 2, which evade successfully just by benign content or random bytes initiation. Corresponding Evasion Rate 0.4
Model1: 0.2 accuracy for detecting adversarial malware. FP: 4 number of adv_x evade successfully.
Model2: 0.0 accuracy for detecting adversarial malware. FP: 5 number of adv_x evade successfully.
