Malware Count : 200


-------------------- Malware input statistics for Evasion Attacks --------------------
200 malware in total.
198 malware predicted as malware at least by one detector
These 198 malware will be used to produce adversarial malware.
Model1 Acc: 0.955; Model2 Acc: 0.985


-------------------- Evasion results --------------------
adversary: FGSM
Successful Evasion Rate 0.0
Two Models True, Acc against adv_x (at least one detector predicted as malware): 1.0
False Positive: 0, which evade detectors successfully in the end. (198 test samples in total)
False Positive just by benign content: 0, which evade successfully just by benign content or random bytes initiation. Corresponding Evasion Rate 0.0
False Positive just by FGSM: 0, which evade successfully just by benign content or random bytes initiation. Corresponding Evasion Rate 0.0
Model1: 0.9595959595959596 accuracy for detecting adversarial malware. FP: 8 number of adv_x evade successfully.
Model2: 0.9949494949494949 accuracy for detecting adversarial malware. FP: 1 number of adv_x evade successfully.
Average number of index crafted for each file: 58.0
Average number of index crafted by gradient optimization for each file: 0.0
198 out of 198 PE files used as testing files (to evade detectors).
